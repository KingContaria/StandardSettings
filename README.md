Resetting Mod for Minecraft Speedrunning


To set your standard settings, copy your options.txt file with your preferred settings and rename it to "standardoptions.txt".

If you want to use additional features, add these lines to the file:

- perspective:0 (Configure the number; 0 = first person, 1 = from the back, 2 = from the front)
- piedirectory:root.tick.level.entities.blockentities (Configure this path to whatever you like)
- hitboxes:true (Configure true/false to show/hide hitboxes)
- chunkborders:false (Configure true/false to show/hide chunkborders)

To change the window title to "Instance X", add an instancenumber.txt file to your .minecraft and type in the instancenumber X.
